<h1 class="article-title"><span>State of the Post-Quantum Internet in 2025</span></h1>
<div>
 <p></p><p>This week, the last week of October 2025, we reached a major milestone for Internet security: the majority of human-initiated traffic with Cloudflare is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption"><u>using</u></a> post-quantum encryption mitigating the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-quantum-menace/"><u>threat</u></a> of <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later"><u>harvest-now/decrypt-later</u></a>.</p>

</figure><p>We want to use this joyous moment to give an update on the current state of the migration of the Internet to post-quantum cryptography and the long road ahead. Our last <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/"><u>overview</u></a> was 21 months ago, and quite a lot has happened since. A lot of it has been passed as we <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/"><u>predicted</u></a>: finalization of the NIST standards; broad adoption of post-quantum encryption; more detailed roadmaps from regulators; progress on building quantum computers; some cryptography was broken (not to worry: nothing close to what’s deployed); and new exciting cryptography was proposed.</p><p>But there were also a few surprises: there was a giant leap in progress towards Q-day by improving quantum algorithms, and we had a proper scare because of a new quantum algorithm. We’ll cover all this and more: what we expect for the coming years; and what you can do today.</p>
<div>
<h2>The quantum threat</h2>
<a href="#the-quantum-threat">
</a>
</div>
<p>First things first: why are we changing our cryptography? It’s because of <b>quantum computers</b>. <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/quantum/what-is-quantum-computing/"><u>These marvelous devices</u></a>, instead of restricting themselves to zeroes and ones, compute using more of what nature actually affords us: quantum superposition, interference, and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to excel at certain very specific computations, notably simulating nature itself, which will be very helpful in developing new materials.</p><p>Quantum computers are not going to replace regular computers, though: they’re actually much worse than regular computers at most tasks that matter for our daily lives. Think of them as graphic cards or neural engines — specialized devices for specific computations, not general-purpose ones.</p><p>Unfortunately, quantum computers also <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-quantum-menace"><u>excel</u></a> at breaking key cryptography that still is in common use today, such as RSA and elliptic curves (ECC). Thus, we are moving to <b>post-quantum cryptography</b>: cryptography designed to be resistant against quantum attack. We’ll discuss the exact impact on the different types of cryptography later on.</p><p>For now, quantum computers are rather anemic: they’re simply not good enough today to crack any real-world cryptographic keys. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t worry yet: encrypted traffic can be <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later"><u>harvested today</u></a>, and decrypted after <b>Q-day</b>: the day that quantum computers are capable of breaking today’s still widely used cryptography such as RSA-2048. We call that a “harvest-now-decrypt-later” attack.</p><p>Using factoring as a benchmark, quantum computers don’t impress at all: the largest number factored by a quantum computer without cheating is 15, a record that’s easily beaten in a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf"><u>variety of funny ways</u></a>. It’s tempting to disregard quantum computers until they start beating classical computers on factoring, but that would be a big mistake. Even conservative estimates place Q-day <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/nJxENYdsB6c?si=doosb_aZRpQgo6X8&amp;t=1302"><u>less than three years</u></a> after the day that quantum computers beat classical computers on factoring. So how do we track progress?</p>
<div>
<h3>Quantum numerology</h3>
<a href="#quantum-numerology">
</a>
</div>
<p>There are two categories to consider in the march towards Q-day: progress on quantum hardware, and algorithmic improvements to the software that runs on that hardware. We have seen significant progress on both fronts.</p>
<div>
<h4>Progress on quantum hardware</h4>
<a href="#progress-on-quantum-hardware">
</a>
</div>
<p>Like clockwork, every year there are news stories of new quantum computers with record-breaking number of qubits. This focus on counting qubits is also quite misleading. To start, quantum computers are analogue machines, and there is always some noise interfering with the computation.</p><p>There are big differences between the different types of technology used to build quantum computers: <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmon"><u>silicon-based</u></a> quantum computers seem to scale well, are quick to execute instructions, but have very noisy qubits. This does not mean they’re useless: with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction"><u>quantum error correcting codes</u></a> one can effectively turn millions of noisy silicon qubits into a few thousand high-fidelity ones, which could be enough to <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/"><u>break RSA</u></a>. <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.quantinuum.com/products-solutions/quantinuum-systems"><u>Trapped-ion quantum computers</u></a>, on the other hand, have much less noise, but have been harder to scale. Only a few hundred-thousand trapped-ion qubits could potentially draw the curtain on RSA-2048.</p><div>
</div>
<p></p><p><sup>Timelapse of </sup><a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape"><sup><u>state-of-art</u></sup></a><sup> in quantum computing from 2021 through 2025 by qubit count on the x-axis and noise on the y-axis. The dots in the gray area are the various quantum computers out there. Once the shaded gray area hits the left-most red line, we’re in trouble as that means a quantum computer can break large RSA keys. Compiled by </sup><a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/"><sup><u>Samuel Jaques</u></sup></a><sup> of the University of Waterloo.</sup></p><p>We’re only scratching the surface with the number of qubits and noise. There are low-level details that can make a big difference, such as the interconnectedness of qubits. More importantly, the graph doesn’t capture how scalable the engineering behind the records is.</p><p>To wit, on these graphs the progress on quantum computers seems to have stalled the last two years, whereas for experts, Google’s <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"><u>December 2024 Willow announcement</u></a> that is unremarkable on the graph, is in reality a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8525"><u>real milestone</u></a> achieving the first logical qubit in the surface code in a scalable manner. <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape_2024"><u>Quoting</u></a> Sam Jaques:</p><blockquote><p>When I first read these results [Willow’s achievements], I felt chills of “Oh wow, quantum computing is actually real”.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a real milestone, but not an unexpected leap. Quoting Sam again:</p><blockquote><p>Despite my enthusiasm, this is more or less where we should expect to be, and maybe a bit late. All of the big breakthroughs they demonstrated are steps we needed to take to even hope to reach the 20 million qubit machine that could break RSA. There are no unexpected breakthroughs. Think of it like the increases in transistor density of classical chips each year: an impressive feat, but ultimately business-as-usual.</p></blockquote><p>Business-as-usual is also the strategy: the superconducting qubit approach pursued by Google for Willow has always had the clearest path forward attacking the difficulties head-on requiring fewest leaps in engineering.</p><p>Microsoft pursues the opposite strategy with their bet on <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer"><u>topological qubits</u></a>. These are qubits that in theory would mostly not be unaffected by noise. However, they have not been fully realized in hardware. If these can be built in a scalable way, they’d be far superior to superconducting qubits. But we don’t even know if these can be built to begin with. Early 2025 Microsoft announced the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8669"><u>Majorana 1</u></a> chip, which demonstrates how these could be built. The chip is far from a full demonstrator though: it doesn’t support any computation and hence doesn’t even show up in Sam’s comparison graph earlier.</p><p>In between topological and superconducting qubits, there are many other approaches that labs across the world pursue that do show up in the graph, such as QuEra with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.quera.com/neutral-atom-platform"><u>neutral atoms</u></a> and Quantinuum with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.quantinuum.com/products-solutions/quantinuum-systems/system-model-h2"><u>trapped ions</u></a>.</p><p>Progress on the hardware side of getting to Q-day has received by far the most amount of press interest. The biggest breakthrough in the last two years isn’t on the hardware side though.</p>

<h4>The biggest breakthrough so far: Craig Gidney’s optimisations</h4>
<a href="#the-biggest-breakthrough-so-far-craig-gidneys-optimisations">
</a>
</div>
<p>We thought we’d need about <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/"><u>20 million qubits</u></a> with the superconducting approach to break RSA-2048. It turns out we can do it with much less. In a stunningly comprehensive June 2025 paper, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://algassert.com/about.html"><u>Craig Gidney</u></a> shows that with clever quantum software optimisations we need fewer than <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15917"><u>one million qubits</u></a>. This is the reason the red lines in Sam’s graph above, marking the size of a quantum computer to break RSA, dramatically shift to the left in 2025.</p><p>To put this achievement into perspective, let’s just make a wild guess and say Google can maintain a sort of Moore’s law and doubles the number of physical qubits every one-and-a-half years. That’s a much faster pace than Google demonstrated so far, but it’s also not unthinkable they could achieve this once the groundwork has been laid. Then it’d take until 2052 to reach 20 million qubits, but only until 2045 to reach one million: Craig single-handedly brought Q-day <b>seven years</b> closer!</p><p>How much further can software optimisations go? Pushing it lower than 100,000 superconducting qubits seems impossible to Sam, and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape_2025"><u>he’d expect</u></a> more than 242,000 superconducting qubits are required to break RSA-2048. With the wild guess on quantum computer progress before, that’d correspond to a Q-day of 2039 and 2041+ respectively.</p><p>Although Craig’s estimate makes detailed and reasonable assumptions on the architecture of a large-scale superconducting qubits quantum computer, it’s still a guess, and these estimates could be off quite a bit.</p>
<div>
<h4>A proper scare: Chen’s algorithm</h4>
<a href="#a-proper-scare-chens-algorithm">
</a>
</div>
<p>On the algorithmic side, we might not only see improvements to existing quantum algorithms, but also the discovery of completely new quantum algorithms. April 2024, Yilei Chen published <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555"><u>a preprint</u></a> claiming to have found such a new quantum algorithm to solve certain lattice problems, which are close, but not the same as those we rely on for the post-quantum cryptography we deploy. This caused a proper stir: even if it couldn’t attack our post-quantum algorithms today, could Chen’s algorithm be improved? To get a sense for potential improvements, you need to understand what the algorithm is really doing on a higher level. With Chen’s algorithm that’s hard, as it’s very complex, much more so than Shor’s quantum algorithm that breaks RSA. So it took some time for experts to <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://nigelsmart.github.io/LWE.html"><u>start</u></a> <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/static/files/555-notes.pdf"><u>seeing</u></a> limitations to Chen’s approach, and in fact, after ten days they discovered a fundamental bug in the algorithm: the approach doesn’t work. Crisis averted.</p><p>What to take from this? Optimistically, this is business as usual for cryptography, and lattices are in a better shape now as one avenue of attack turned out to be a dead end. Realistically, it <i>is</i> a reminder that we have a lot of eggs in the lattices basket. As we’ll see later, presently there isn’t a real alternative that works everywhere.</p><p>Proponents of quantum key distribution (QKD) might chime in that QKD solves exactly that by being secure thanks to the laws of nature. Well, there are some asterixes to put on that claim, but more fundamentally no one has figured out how to scale QKD beyond point-to-point connections, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/you-dont-need-quantum-hardware/"><u>as we argue in this blog post</u></a>.</p><p>It’s good to speculate about what cryptography might be broken by a completely new attack, but let’s not forget the matter at hand: a lot of cryptography is going to be broken by quantum computers for sure. Q-day is coming; the question is when.</p>
<div>
<h2>Is Q-day always fifteen years away?</h2>
<a href="#is-q-day-always-fifteen-years-away">
</a>
</div>
<p>If you've been working on or around cryptography and security long enough, then you have probably heard that "Q-day is X years away" every year for the last several years. This can make it feel like Q-day is always "some time in the future" — until we put such a claim in the proper context.</p>

<p>Since 2019, the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://globalriskinstitute.org/"><u>Global Risk Institute</u></a> has performed a yearly survey amongst experts, asking how probable it is that RSA-2048 will be broken within 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years.

<h3>What action do regulators take?</h3>
<a href="#what-action-do-regulators-take">
</a>
</div>
<p>We can also look at the timelines of various regulators. In 2022, the National Security Agency (NSA) released their <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/30/2003728741/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS.PDF"><u>CNSA 2.0 guidelines</u></a>, which has deadlines between 2030 and 2033 for migrating to post-quantum cryptography. Also in 2022, the US federal government <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240422052137/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/"><u>set 2035</u></a> as the target to have the United States fully migrated, from which the new administration hasn’t deviated.

<div>
<h3>When is Q-day?</h3>
<a href="#when-is-q-day">
</a>
</div>
<p>So when will quantum computers start causing trouble? Whether it’s 2034 or 2050, for sure it will be <b>too soon</b>. The immense success of cryptography over fifty years means it’s all around us now, from dishwasher, to pacemaker, to satellite. Most upgrades will be easy, and fit naturally in the product’s lifecycle, but there will be a long tail of difficult and costly upgrades.</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at the migration to post-quantum cryptography.</p>
<div>
<h2>Mitigating the quantum threat: two migrations</h2>
<a href="#mitigating-the-quantum-threat-two-migrations">
</a>
</div>
<p>To help prioritize, it is important to understand that there is a big difference in the difficulty, impact, and urgency of the post-quantum migration for the different kinds of cryptography required to create secure connections. In fact, for most organizations there will be two post-quantum migrations: <b>key agreement</b> and <b>signatures / certificates</b>. Let’s explain this for the case of creating a secure connection when visiting a website in a browser.</p>
<div>
<h3>Already post-quantum secure: symmetric cryptography</h3>
<a href="#already-post-quantum-secure-symmetric-cryptography">
</a>
</div>
<p>The cryptographic workhorse of a connection is a <b>symmetric cipher </b>such as AES-GCM. It’s what you would think of when thinking of cryptography: both parties, in this case the browser and server, have a shared key, and they encrypt / decrypt their messages with the same key. Unless you have that key, you can’t read anything, or modify anything.</p><p>The good news is that symmetric ciphers, such as <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-crypto-bridging-the-performance-gap/"><u>AES-GCM</u></a>, are already post-quantum secure. There is a common misconception that <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm"><u>Grover’s quantum algorithm</u></a> requires us to double the length of symmetric keys. On closer inspection of the algorithm, it’s clear that it is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise#grover-s-algorithm"><u>not</u></a> <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB4po9Br1YY"><u>practical</u></a>. The way <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nist.gov/"><u>NIST</u></a>, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (who have been spearheading the standardization of post-quantum cryptography) defines their post-quantum security levels is very telling. They define a specific security level by saying the scheme should be as hard to crack using either a classical or quantum computer as an existing symmetric cipher as follows:</p><table><tr><td><p><b>Level</b></p></td><td><p><b>Definition,</b> as least as hard to break as … </p></td><td><p><b>Example</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-128</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-512, SLH-DSA-128s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>To find a collision in <b>SHA256</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-DSA-44</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-192</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>To find a collision in <b>SHA384</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-256</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-1024, SLH-DSA-256s, ML-DSA-87</p></td></tr></table><p><sup>NIST PQC security levels, higher is harder to break (“more secure”). The examples ML-DSA, SLH-DSA and ML-KEM are covered below.</sup></p><p>There are good intentions behind suggesting doubling the key lengths of symmetric cryptography. In many use cases, the extra cost is not that high, and it mitigates any theoretical risk completely. Scaling symmetric cryptography is cheap: double the bits is typically far less than half the cost. So on the surface, it is simple advice.</p><p>But if we insist on AES-256, it seems only logical to insist on NIST PQC level 5 for the public key cryptography as well. The problem is that public key cryptography does not scale very well. Depending on the scheme, going from level 1 to level 5 typically more than doubles data usage and CPU cost. As we’ll see, deploying post-quantum signatures at level 1 is already painful, and deploying them at level 5 is debilitating.</p><p>But more importantly, organizations only have limited resources. We wouldn’t want an organization to prioritize upgrading AES-128 at the cost of leaving the definitely quantum-vulnerable RSA around.</p>
<div>
<h3>First migration: key agreement</h3>
<a href="#first-migration-key-agreement">
</a>
</div>
<p>Symmetric ciphers are not enough on their own: how do I know which key to use when visiting a website for the first time? The browser can’t just send a random key, as everyone listening in would see that key as well. You’d think it’s impossible, but there is some clever math to solve this, so that the browser and server can agree on a shared key. Such a scheme is called a <b>key agreement </b>mechanism, and is performed in the TLS <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/"><u>handshake</u></a>. In 2024 almost all traffic is secured with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519"><u>X25519</u></a>, a Diffie–Hellman-style key agreement, but its security is completely broken by <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm"><u>Shor’s algorithm</u></a> on a quantum computer. Thus, any communication secured today with Diffie–Hellman, when stored, can be decrypted in the future by a quantum computer.</p><p>This makes it <b>urgent</b> to upgrade key agreement today. Luckily post-quantum key agreement is relatively straight-forward to deploy, and as we saw before, half the requests with Cloudflare end 2025 are already secured with post-quantum key agreement!</p>
<div>
<h3>Second migration: signatures / certificates</h3>
<a href="#second-migration-signatures-certificates">
</a>
</div>
<p>The key agreement allows secure agreement on a key, but there is a big gap: we do not know <i>with whom</i> we agreed on the key. If we only do key agreement, an attacker in the middle can do separate key agreements with the browser and server, and re-encrypt any exchanged messages. To prevent this we need one final ingredient: authentication.</p><p>This is achieved using <b>signatures</b>. When visiting a website, say <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudflare.com"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>, the web server presents a <b>certificate</b> signed by a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority"><u>certification authority</u></a> (CA) that vouches that the public key in that certificate is controlled by <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudflare.com"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>. In turn, the web server signs the handshake and shared key using the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate. This allows the client to be sure that they’ve done a key agreement with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudflare.com"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>.</p><p>RSA and ECDSA are commonly used traditional signature schemes today. Again, Shor’s algorithm makes short work of them, allowing a quantum attacker to forge any signature. That means that an attacker with a quantum computer can impersonate (and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><u>MitM</u></a>) any website for which we accept non post-quantum certificates.</p><p>This attack can only be performed after quantum computers are able to crack RSA / ECDSA. This makes upgrading signature schemes for TLS on the face of it less urgent, as we only need to have everyone migrated before Q-day rolls around. Unfortunately, we will see that migration to post-quantum signatures is much <b>more difficult</b>, and will require more time.</p>
<div>
<h2>Progress timeline</h2>
<a href="#progress-timeline">
</a>
</div>
<p>Before we dive into the technical challenges of migrating the Internet to post-quantum cryptography, let’s have a look at how we got here, and what to expect in the coming years. Let’s start with how post-quantum cryptography came to be.</p>
<div>
<h3>Origin of post-quantum cryptography</h3>
<a href="#origin-of-post-quantum-cryptography">
</a>
</div>
<p>Physicists Feynman and Manin independently proposed quantum computers <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-quantcomp/"><u>around 1980</u></a>. It took another 14 years before Shor published <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/365700"><u>his algorithm</u></a> attacking RSA / ECC. Most post-quantum cryptography predates Shor’s famous algorithm.</p><p>There are various branches of post-quantum cryptography, of which the most prominent are lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate, code-based, and isogeny-based. Except for isogeny-based cryptography, none of these were initially conceived as post-quantum cryptography. In fact, early code-based and hash-based schemes are contemporaries of RSA, being proposed in the 1970s, and comfortably predate the publication of Shor’s algorithm in 1994. Also, the first multivariate scheme from 1988 is comfortably older than Shor’s algorithm. It is a nice coincidence that the most successful branch, lattice-based cryptography, is Shor’s closest contemporary, being proposed <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/237814.237838"><u>in 1996</u></a>. For comparison, elliptic curve cryptography, which is widely used today, was first proposed in 1985.</p><p>In the years after the publication of Shor’s algorithm, cryptographers took measure of the existing cryptography: what’s clearly broken, and what could be post-quantum secure? In 2006, the first annual <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://postquantum.cr.yp.to/"><u>International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography</u></a> took place. From that conference, an introductory text <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas-Sendrier-2/publication/226115302_Code-Based_Cryptography/links/540d62d50cf2df04e7549388/Code-Based-Cryptography.pdf"><u>was prepared</u></a>, which holds up rather well as an introduction to the field. A notable caveat is the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf"><u>demise</u></a> of the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pqcrainbow.org/"><u>Rainbow</u></a> signature scheme. In that same year, 2006, the elliptic-curve key-agreement X25519 <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cr.yp.to/ecdh/curve25519-20060209.pdf"><u>was proposed</u></a>, which now secures the majority of Internet connections, either on its own or as a hybrid with the post-quantum ML-KEM-768. </p>

<p>Ten years later, in 2016, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://nist.gov"><u>NIST</u></a>, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/documents/call-for-proposals-final-dec-2016.pdf"><u>launched a public competition</u></a> to standardize post-quantum cryptography. They used a similar open format as was used to standardize <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"><u>AES</u></a> in 2001, and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_hash_function_competition"><u>SHA3</u></a> in 2012.

<h2>Adoption of PQC in protocol standards</h2>
<a href="#adoption-of-pqc-in-protocol-standards">
</a>
</div>
<p>Having NIST’s standards is not enough. It’s also required to standardize the way the new algorithms are used in higher level protocols. In many cases, such as key agreement in TLS, this can be as simple as assigning an identifier to the new algorithms. In other cases, such as <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/"><u>DNSSEC</u></a>, it requires a bit more thought. Many working groups at the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ietf.org/"><u>IETF</u></a> have been preparing for years for the arrival of NIST’s final standards, and we expected many protocol integrations to be finalized soon after, before the end of 2024. That was too optimistic: some are done, but many are not finished yet.</p><p>Let’s start with the good news and look at what is done.</p><ul><li><p>The hybrid TLS key agreement <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/"><u>X25519MLKEM768</u></a> that combines X25519 and ML-KEM-768 (more about it later) is ready to use and is indeed quite widely deployed. Other protocols are likewise adopting ML-KEM in a hybrid mode of operation, such as <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem/"><u>IPsec</u></a>, which is ready to go for simple setups. (For certain setups, there is a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-downgrade-prevention/"><u>little wrinkle</u></a> that still needs to be figured out. We’ll cover that in a future blog post.)

</p><p>It might be surprising that the corresponding RFCs have not been published yet. Registering a key agreement to TLS or IPsec does not require an RFC though. In both cases, the RFC is still being pursued to avoid confusion for those that would expect an RFC, and for TLS it’s required to mark the key agreement as recommended.</p></li><li><p>For signatures, ML-DSA’s integration <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates/"><u>in X.509</u></a> certificates and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-mldsa/"><u>TLS</u></a> are good to go. The former is a freshly minted RFC, and the latter doesn’t require one.</p></li></ul><p>Now, for the bad news. At the time of writing, October 2025, the IETF hasn’t <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/"><u>locked down</u></a> how to do hybrid certificates: certificates where both a post-quantum and a traditional signature scheme are combined. But it’s close. We hope this’ll be figured out early 2026.</p><p>But if it’s just assigning some identifiers, what’s the cause of the delay? Mostly it’s about choice. Let’s start with the choices that had to be made in ML-DSA.</p><p></p>
<div>
<h4>ML-DSA delays: much ado about prehashing and private key formats</h4>
<a href="#ml-dsa-delays-much-ado-about-prehashing-and-private-key-formats">
</a>
</div>
<p>The two major topics of discussion for ML-DSA certificates were prehashing and the private key format.</p><p>Prehashing is where one part of the system hashes the message, and another creates the final signatures. This is useful, if you don’t want to send a big file to an <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module"><u>HSM</u></a> to sign. Early drafts of ML-DSA  support prehashing with SHAKE256, but that <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/documents/faq/fips204-sec6-03192025.pdf"><u>was</u></a> not obvious. In the final version of ML-DSA, NIST included two variants: regular ML-DSA, and an explicitly prehashed version, where you are allowed to choose any hash. Having different variants is not ideal, as users will have to choose which one to pick; not all software might support all variants; and testing/validation has to be done for all. It’s not controversial to want to pick just one variant, but the issue <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4_ML-DSA-and-ML-KEM-Landmines-1.pdf"><u>is</u></a> <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://keymaterial.net/2024/11/05/hashml-dsa-considered-harmful/"><u>which</u></a>. After plenty of debate, regular ML-DSA was chosen.</p><p>The second matter is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/materials/slides-122-pquip-the-great-private-key-war-of-25-02.pdf"><u>private key forma</u></a>t. Because of the way that candidates are compared on performance benchmarks, it looks good for the original ML-DSA submission to cache some computation in the private key. This means that the private key is larger (several kilobytes) than it needs to be and requires more validation steps. It was suggested to cut the private key down to its bare essentials: just a 32-byte <i>seed</i>. For the final standard, NIST decided to allow both the seed and the original larger private key. This is not <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://keymaterial.net/2025/02/19/how-not-to-format-a-private-key/"><u>ideal</u></a>: better stick to one of the two. In this case, the IETF wasn’t able to make a choice, and even added a third option: a pair of both the seed and expanded private key. Technically almost everyone agreed that <i>seed</i> is the superior choice, but the reason it wasn’t palatable is that some vendors already created keys for which they didn’t keep the <i>seed</i> around. Yes, we already have post-quantum legacy. It took almost a year to make these two choices.</p>
<div>
<h4>Hybrids require many choices</h4>
<a href="#hybrids-require-many-choices">
</a>
</div>
<p>To define an ML-DSA hybrid signature scheme, there are many more choices to make. With which traditional scheme to combine ML-DSA? What security levels on both sides. Then we also need to make choices for both schemes: which private key format to use? Which hash to use with ECDSA? Hybrids have new questions of their own. Do we allow reuse of the keys in the hybrid, and for that, do we want to prevent stripping attacks? Also, the question of prehashing returns with a third option: prehash on the hybrid level.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/12/"><u>October 2025 draft</u></a> for ML-DSA hybrid signatures contains 18 variants, down from <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/03/"><u>26</u></a> a year earlier. Again, everyone agrees that that is too much, but it’s been hard to whittle it down further. To help end-users choose, a short list was added, which started with three options, and of course grew itself to <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs-12.html#section-11.3"><u>six</u></a>. Of those, we think MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 will see wide support and use on the Internet.</p><p>Now, let’s return to key agreement for which the standards have been set.</p>
<div>
<h2>TLS stacks get support for ML-KEM</h2>
<a href="#tls-stacks-get-support-for-ml-kem">
</a>
</div>
<p>The next step is software support. Not all ecosystems can move at the same speed, but we’ve seen major adoption of post-quantum key agreement to counter store-now/decrypt-later already. Recent versions of all major browsers, and many TLS libraries and platforms, notably OpenSSL, Go, and recent Apple OSes have enabled X25519MLKEM768 by default. We keep an overview <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/pqc-support/"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>Again, for TLS there is a big difference again between key agreement and signatures. For key agreement, the server and client can add and enable support for post-quantum key agreement independently. Once enabled on both sides, TLS negotiation will use post-quantum key agreement. We go into detail on TLS negotiation in <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all#tls-anchor"><u>this blog post</u></a>. If your product just uses TLS, your store-now/decrypt-now problem could be solved by a simple software update of the TLS library.</p><p>Post-quantum TLS certificates are more of a hassle. Unless you control both ends, you’ll need to install two certificates: one post-quantum certificate for the new clients, and a traditional one for the old clients. If you aren’t using automated issuance of certificates yet, this might be a good reason to <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/"><u>check that out</u></a>. TLS allows the client to signal which signature schemes it supports so that the server can choose to serve a post-quantum certificate only to those clients that support it. Unfortunately, although almost all TLS libraries support setting up multiple certificates, not all servers expose that configuration. If they do, it will still require a configuration change in most cases. (Although undoubtedly <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://caddyserver.com/"><u>caddy</u></a> will do it for you.)</p><p>Talking about post-quantum certificates: it will take some time before Certification Authorities (CAs) can issue them. Their <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/hardware_security_module_hsm"><u>HSMs</u></a> will first need (hardware) support, which then will need to be audited. Also, the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cabforum.org/"><u>CA/Browser forum</u></a> needs to approve the use of the new algorithms. Root programs have different opinions about timelines. From the grapevine, we hear one of the root programs is preparing a pilot to accept one-year ML-DSA-87 certificates, perhaps even before the end of 2025. A CA/Browser forum ballot is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/pull/624"><u>being drafted</u></a> to support this. Chrome on the other hand, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/O_BXzJv16zQ?t=19274s"><u>prefers</u></a> to solve the large certificate issue first. For the early movers, the audits are likely to be the bottleneck, as there will be a lot of submissions after the publication of the NIST standards. Although we’ll see the first post-quantum certificates in 2026, it’s unlikely they will be broadly available or trusted by all browsers before 2027.</p><p>We are in an interesting in-between time, where a lot of Internet traffic is protected by post-quantum key agreement, but not a single public post-quantum certificate is used.</p>
<div>
<h2>The search continues for more schemes</h2>
<a href="#the-search-continues-for-more-schemes">
</a>
</div>
<p>NIST is not quite done standardizing post-quantum cryptography. There are two more post-quantum competitions running: <b>round 4</b> and the <b>signatures onramp</b>.</p>
<div>
<h3>Round 4 winner: HQC</h3>
<a href="#round-4-winner-hqc">
</a>
</div>
<p>NIST only standardized one post-quantum key agreement so far: ML-KEM. They’d like to have a second one, a <b>backup KEM</b>, not based on lattices in case those turn out to be weaker than expected. To find it,  they extended the original competition with a fourth round to pick a backup KEM among the finalists. In March 2025, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption#:~:text=NIST%20has%20chosen%20a%20new,were%20discovered%20in%20ML%2DKEM."><u>HQC</u></a> was <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption#:~:text=NIST%20has%20chosen%20a%20new,were%20discovered%20in%20ML%2DKEM."><u>selected</u></a> to be standardized.</p><p>HQC performs much worse than ML-KEM on every single metric. HQC-1, the lowest security level variant, requires 7kB of data on the wire. This is almost double the 3kB required for ML-KEM-1024, the highest security level variant. There is a similar gap in CPU performance. Also HQC scales worse with security level: where ML-KEM-1024 is about double the cost of ML-KEM-512, the highest security level of HQC requires three times the data (21kB!) and more than four times the compute.</p><p>What about the security? To hedge against gradually improved attacks, ML-KEM-768 has a clear edge over HQC-1, it performs much better, and it has a huge security margin at level 3 compared to level 1. What about leaps? Both ML-KEM and HQC use a similar algebraic structure on top of plain lattices and codes respectively: it is not inconceivable that a breakthrough there could apply to both. Now, also without the algebraic structure, codes and lattices feel related. We’re well into speculation: a catastrophic attack on lattices might not affect codes, but it wouldn’t be surprising too if it did. After all, RSA and ECC that are more dissimilar are both broken by quantum computers.</p><p>There might still be peace of mind to keep HQC around just in case. Here, we’d like to share an anecdote from the chaotic week when it was not clear yet that Chen’s quantum algorithm against lattices was flawed. What to replace ML-KEM with if it would be affected? HQC was briefly considered, but it was clear that an adjusted variant of ML-KEM would still be much more performant.</p><p>Stepping back: that we’re looking for a <i>second</i> efficient KEM is a luxury position. If I were granted a wish for a new post-quantum scheme, I wouldn’t ask for a better KEM, but for a better signature scheme. Let’s see if I get lucky.</p>
<div>
<h3>Signatures onramp</h3>
<a href="#signatures-onramp">
</a>
</div>
<p>In late 2022, after announcing the first four picks, NIST also called a new competition, dubbed the <i>signatures onramp</i>, to find <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig"><u>additional signature schemes</u></a>. The competition has two goals. The first is hedging against cryptanalytic breakthroughs against lattice-based cryptography. NIST would like to standardize a signature that performs better than SLH-DSA (both in size and compute), but is not based on lattices. Secondly, they’re looking for a signature scheme that might do well in use cases where the current roster doesn’t do well: we will discuss those at length later on in this post.</p><p>In July 2023, NIST posted the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2023/additional-pqc-digital-signature-candidates"><u>40 submissions</u></a> they received for a first round of public review. The cryptographic community got to work, and as is quite normal for a first round, many of the schemes were broken within a week. By February 2024, ten submissions were broken completely, and several others were weakened drastically. Out of the standing candidates, in October 2024, NIST selected 14 submissions for the second round.</p><p>A year ago, we wrote <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/"><u>a blog post</u></a> covering these 14 submissions in great detail. The short of it: there has been amazing progress on post-quantum signature schemes. We will touch briefly upon them later on, and give some updates on the advances since last year. It is worth mentioning that just like the main post-quantum competition, the selection process will take many years. It is unlikely that any of these onramp signature schemes will be standardized before 2028 — if they’re not broken in the first place. That means that although they’re very welcome in the future, we can’t trust that better signature schemes will solve our problems today. As Eric Rescorla, the editor of TLS 1.3, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/pq-emergency/"><u>writes</u></a>: “You go to war with the algorithms you have, not the ones you wish you had.”</p><p>With that in mind, let's look at the progress of deployments.</p>
<div>
<h2>Migrating the Internet to post-quantum key agreement</h2>
<a href="#migrating-the-internet-to-post-quantum-key-agreement">
</a>
</div>
<p>Now that we have the big picture, let’s dive into some finer details about this X25519MLKEM768 that’s widely deployed now.</p><p>First the post-quantum part. ML-KEM was submitted under the name <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml"><u>CRYSTALS-Kyber</u></a>. Even though it’s a US standard, its designers work in industry and academia across France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Canada, China, and the United States. Let’s have a look at its performance.</p>
<div>
<h2>ML-KEM versus X25519</h2>
<a href="#ml-kem-versus-x25519">
</a>
</div>
<p>Today the vast majority of clients use the traditional key agreement X25519. Let’s compare that to ML-KEM.</p>

</figure><p><sup>Size and CPU compared between X25519 and ML-KEM. Performance varies considerably by hardware platform and implementation constraints, and should be taken as a rough indication only.</sup></p><p>ML-KEM-512, -768 and -1024 aim to be as resistant to (quantum) attack as AES-128, -192 and -256 respectively. Even at the AES-128 level, ML-KEM is much bigger than X25519, requiring 800+768=1,568 bytes over the wire, whereas X25519 requires a mere 64 bytes.</p><p>On the other hand, even ML-KEM-1024 is typically significantly faster than X25519, although this can vary quite a bit depending on your platform and implementation.</p>
<div>
<h2>ML-KEM-768 and X25519</h2>
<a href="#ml-kem-768-and-x25519">
</a>
</div>
<p>We are not taking advantage of that speed boost just yet. Like many other early adopters, we like to play it safe and deploy a <b>hybrid</b> key-agreement <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/"><u>combining</u></a> X25519 and ML-KEM-768. This combination might surprise you for two reasons.</p><ol><li><p>Why combine X25519 (“128 bits of security”) with ML-KEM-768 (“192 bits of security”)?</p></li><li><p>Why bother with the non post-quantum X25519?</p></li></ol><p>The apparent security level mismatch is a hedge against improvements in cryptanalysis in lattice-based cryptography. There is a lot of trust in the (non post-quantum) security of X25519: matching AES-128 is more than enough. Although we are comfortable in the security of ML-KEM-512 today, over the coming decades cryptanalysis could improve. Thus, we’d like to keep a margin for now.</p><p>The inclusion of X25519 has two reasons. First, there is always a remote chance that a breakthrough renders all variants of ML-KEM insecure. In that case, X25519 still provides non-post-quantum security, and our post-quantum migration didn’t make things worse.</p><p>More important is that we do not only worry about attacks on the algorithm, but also on the implementation. A noteworthy example where we dodged a bullet is that of <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/"><u>KyberSlash</u></a>, a timing attack that affected many implementations of Kyber (an earlier version of ML-KEM), including <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/security/advisories/GHSA-9763-4f94-gfch"><u>our own</u></a>. Luckily KyberSlash does not affect Kyber as it is used in TLS. A similar implementation mistake that would actually affect TLS, is likely to require an active attacker. In that case, the likely aim of the attacker wouldn’t be to decrypt data decades down the line, but steal a cookie or other token, or inject a payload. Including X25519 prevents such an attack.</p><p>So how well do ML-KEM-768 and X25519 together perform in practice?</p>

<h3>Browser experiments</h3>

<p>Being well aware of potential compatibility and performance issues, Google started <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html"><u>a first experiment</u></a> with post-quantum cryptography back in 2016, the same year NIST started their competition. This was followed up by a second larger joint experiment by <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/"><u>Cloudflare</u></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/12/12/cecpq2.html"><u>Google</u></a> in 2018. We tested two different hybrid post-quantum key agreements: CECPQ2, which is a combination of the lattice-based NTRU-HRSS and X25519, and CECPQ2b, a combination of the isogeny-based SIKE and again X25519. NTRU-HRSS is very similar to ML-KEM in size, but is computationally somewhat more taxing on the client-side. SIKE on the other hand, has very small keys, is computationally very expensive, and was <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975.pdf"><u>completely broken</u></a> in 2022. With respect to TLS handshake times, X25519+NTRU-HRSS performed very well.</p><p>Unfortunately, a small but significant fraction of clients experienced broken connections with NTRU-HRSS. The reason: the size of the NTRU-HRSS keyshares. In the past, when creating a TLS connection, the first message sent by the client, the so-called <i>ClientHello</i>, almost always fit within a single network packet. The TLS specification allows for a larger <i>ClientHello</i>, however no one really made use of that. Thus, protocol ossification strikes again as there are some middleboxes, load-balancers, and other software that tacitly assume the <i>ClientHello</i> always fits in a single packet.</p>

<h2>Long road to 50%</h2>
<a href="#long-road-to-50">

</div>
<p>Over the subsequent years, we kept experimenting with PQ, switching to Kyber in 2022, and ML-KEM in 2024. Chrome did a great job reaching out to vendors whose products were <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://tldr.fail/"><u>incompatible</u></a>. If it were not for these compatibility issues, we would’ve likely seen Chrome ramp up post-quantum key agreement five years earlier. It took until March 2024 before Chrome felt comfortable enough to enable post-quantum key agreement by default on Desktop. After that many other clients, and all major browsers, have joined Chrome in enabling post-quantum key agreement by default. An incomplete timeline:</p><table><tr><td><p>July 2016</p></td><td><p>Chrome’s <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html"><u>first experiment with PQ</u></a> (CECPQ)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>June 2018</p></td><td><p><a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/"><u>Cloudflare</u></a> / <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/12/12/cecpq2.html"><u>Google</u></a> experiment (CECPQ2)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2022</p></td><td><p>Cloudflare <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"><u>enables</u></a> PQ by default server side</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2023</p></td><td><p>Chrome ramps up PQ to 10% on Desktop</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>March 2024</p></td><td><p>Chrome <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html"><u>enables</u></a> PQ by default on Desktop</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>August 2024</p></td><td><p>Go <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/67061"><u>enables</u></a> PQ by default</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2024</p></td><td><p>Chrome enables PQ by default on Android and Firefox on Desktop.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>April 2025</p></td><td><p><a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://openssl-library.org/post/2025-04-08-openssl-35-final-release/"><u>OpenSSL</u></a> enables PQ by default</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2025</p></td><td><p>Apple is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122756"><u>rolling out</u></a> PQ by default with the release of iOS / iPadOS / macOS 26.</p></td></tr></table><p>It’s noteworthy that there is a gap between Chrome enabling PQ on Desktop and on Android.

<h3>Server-side support</h3>
<a href="#server-side-support">
</a>
</div>
<p>Back in 2022 we <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"><u>enabled</u></a> post-quantum key agreement server side for basically all customers. Google did the same for most of their servers (except GCP) in 2023. Since then many have followed. Jan Schaumann has been posting regular scans of the top 100k domains. In his September 2025 post, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/pqc-use-2025-09.html"><u>he reports</u></a> 39% support PQ now, up from 28% only six months earlier. In his survey, we see not only support rolling out on large service providers, such as Amazon, Fastly, Squarespace, Google, and Microsoft, but also a trickle of self-hosted servers adding support hosted at Hetzner and OVHcloud.</p><p>This is the publicly accessible web. What about servers behind a service like Cloudflare?</p>
<div>
<h3>Support at origins</h3>

</div>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-to-origins"><u>September 2023</u></a>, we added support for our customers to enable post-quantum key agreement on connections from Cloudflare to their origins. That’s connection (3) in the following diagram:</p>

</figure><p><sup>Typical connection flow when a visitor requests an uncached page.</sup></p><p>Back in 2023 only 0.5% of origins supported post-quantum key agreement.

</figure><p><sup>Fraction of origins that support the post-quantum key agreement X25519MLKEM768.</sup></p><p>3.7% doesn’t sound impressive at all compared to the previous 50% and 39% for clients and public servers respectively, but it’s nothing to scoff at. There is much more diversity in origins than there are in clients: many more people have to do something to make that number move up. But it’s still a more than seven-fold increase, and let’s not forget that back in 2024 we celebrated reaching 1.8% of client support.For customers, origins aren’t always easy to upgrade at all. Does that mean missing out on post-quantum security? No, not necessarily: you can secure the connection between Cloudflare and your origin by setting up <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a> as a sidecar to your origin.</p>

<div>
<h3>Ossification</h3>
<a href="#ossification">
</a>
</div>
<p>Support is all well and good, but as we saw with browser experiments, protocol ossification is a big concern. What does it look like with origins? Well, it depends.</p><p>There are two ways to enable post-quantum key agreement: the fast way, and the slow but safer way. In both cases, if the origin doesn’t support post-quantum, they’ll fall back safely to traditional key agreement. We explain the details in this <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-to-origins"><u>blog post</u></a>, but in short, in the fast way we send the post-quantum keys immediately, and in the safer way we postpone it by one roundtrip using <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>. All major browsers use the fast way.</p><p>We have been regularly scanning all origins to see what they support. The good news is that all origins supported the safe but slow method. The fast method didn’t fare as well, as we found that 0.05% of connections would break. That’s too high to enable the fast method by default. We did enable PQ to origins using the safer method by default for all non-enterprise customers and enterprise customers can opt in.</p><p>We are not satisfied though until it’s fast and enabled for everyone. That’s why we’ll <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-secure/#post-quantum-era"><u>automatically enable</u></a> post-quantum to origins using the fast method for all customers, if our scans show it’s safe.</p>
<div>
<h3>Internal connections</h3>
<a href="#internal-connections">
</a>
</div>
<p>So far all the connections we’ve been talking about are between Cloudflare and external parties. There are also a lot of internal connections within Cloudflare (marked 2 in the two diagrams above.) In 2023 we <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-cryptography-ga/"><u>made a big push</u></a> to upgrade our internal connections to post-quantum key agreement. Compared to all the other post-quantum efforts we pursue, this has been, by far, the biggest job: we asked every engineering team in the company to stop what they’re doing; take stock of the data and connections that their products secure; and upgrade them to post-quantum key agreement. In most cases the upgrade was simple. In fact, many teams were already upgraded by pulling in software updates. Still, figuring out that you’re already done can take quite some time! On a positive note, we didn’t see any performance or ossification issues in this push.</p><p>We have upgraded the majority of internal connections, but a long tail remains, which we continue to work on. The most important connection that we didn’t get to upgrade in 2023 is the connection between WARP client and Cloudflare. In September 2025 we <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-warp/"><u>upgraded it</u></a>, by moving from Wireguard to QUIC.</p>
<div>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<a href="#outlook">
</a>
</div>
<p>As we’ve seen, post-quantum key agreement, despite initial trouble with protocol ossification, has been straightforward to deploy. In the vast majority of cases it’s an uneventful software update. And with 50% deployment (and rising), it’s the new security baseline for the Internet.</p><p>Let’s turn to the second, more difficult migration.</p>
<div>
<h2>Migrating the Internet to post-quantum signatures</h2>
<a href="#migrating-the-internet-to-post-quantum-signatures">

</div>
<p>Now, we’ll turn our attention to upgrading the signatures used on the Internet.</p>
<div>
<h2>The zoo of post-quantum signatures</h2>
<a href="#the-zoo-of-post-quantum-signatures">
</a>
</div>
<p>We wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/"><u>long deep dive</u></a> in the field of post-quantum signature schemes last year, November 2024. Most of that is still up-to-date, but there have been some exciting developments. Here we’ll just go over some highlights and some exciting updates of last year.</p><p>Let’s start by sizing up the post-quantum signatures we have available today at the AES-128 security level: ML-DSA-44 and the two variants of SLH-DSA. We use ML-DSA-44 as the baseline, as that’s the scheme that’s going to see the most widespread use initially. As a comparison, we also include the venerable Ed25519 and RSA-2048 in wide use today, as well as FN-DSA-512 which will be standardised soon and a sample of nine for TLS promising signature schemes from the signatures onramp.</p>
<figure>
<img class="lazy" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAADhlWElmTU0AKgAAAAgAAYdpAAQAAAABAAAAGgAAAAAAAqACAAQAAAABAAAAAaADAAQAAAABAAAAAQAAAADa6r/EAAAAC0lEQVQIHWNgAAIAAAUAAY27m/MAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://cors.mhuig.top/?r=https://blog.cloudflare.com&url=https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4NC2lO6hXKEFOgaVgQ7ExO/a0a65ddbb24d11ad96405f19aa344f4b/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_13.18.54.png">
</figure><p><sup>Comparison of various signature schemes at the security level of AES-128. CPU times vary significantly by platform and implementation constraints and should be taken as a rough indication only. ⚠️ FN-DSA signing time when using fast but dangerous floating-point arithmetic — see warning below. ⚠️ SQISign signing is not timing side-channel secure.</sup></p><p>It is immediately clear that none of the post-quantum signature schemes comes even close to being a drop-in replacement for Ed25519 (which is comparable to ECDSA P-256) as most of the signatures are simply much bigger. The exceptions are SQISign, MAYO, SNOVA, and UOV from the onramp, but they’re far from ideal. MAYO, SNOVA, and UOV have large public keys, and SQISign requires a great amount of computation.</p>
<div>
<h3>Be careful with FN-DSA</h3>
<a href="#be-careful-with-fn-dsa">
</a>
</div>
<p>Looking ahead a bit: the best of the first competition seems to be FN-DSA-512. FN-DSA-512’s signatures and public key together are <i>only</i> 1,563 bytes, with somewhat reasonable signing time. FN-DSA has an <b>achilles heel</b> though — for acceptable signing performance, it requires fast floating-point arithmetic. Without it, signing is about 20 times slower. But speed is not enough, as the floating-point arithmetic has to run in constant time — without it, the FN-DSA private key can be recovered by timing signature creation. Writing safe FN-DSA implementations has turned out to be quite challenging, which makes FN-DSA dangerous when signatures are generated on the fly, such as in a TLS handshake. It is good to stress that this only affects signing. FN-DSA verification does not require floating-point arithmetic (and during verification there wouldn’t be a private key to leak anyway.)</p>
<div>
<h2>There are many signatures on the web</h2>
<a href="#there-are-many-signatures-on-the-web">
</a>
</div>
<p>The biggest pain-point of migrating the Internet to post-quantum signatures, is that there are a lot of signatures even in a single connection. When you visit this very website for the first time, we send <b>five signatures and two public keys</b>.</p>
<figure>
<img class="lazy" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAADhlWElmTU0AKgAAAAgAAYdpAAQAAAABAAAAGgAAAAAAAqACAAQAAAABAAAAAaADAAQAAAABAAAAAQAAAADa6r/EAAAAC0lEQVQIHWNgAAIAAAUAAY27m/MAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://cors.mhuig.top/?r=https://blog.cloudflare.com&url=https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6frWEoCLnBEZ5qztV8XoT4/25bd315190d8914f42f282679d6f525a/image9.png">
</figure><p>The majority of these are for the <b>certificate chain</b>: the CA signs the intermediate certificate, which signs the leaf certificate, which in turn signs the TLS transcript to prove the authenticity of the server. If you’re keeping count: we’re still two signatures short.</p><p>These are for <b>SCTs</b> required for <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/howctworks/"><u>certificate transparency</u></a>. Certificate transparency (CT) is a key, but lesser known, part of the <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/#web-pki-vs-internal-pki"><u>Web PKI</u></a>, the ecosystem that secures browser connections. Its goal is to publicly log every certificate issued, so that misissuances can be detected after the fact. It’s the system that’s behind <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://crt.sh"><u>crt.sh</u></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/new-regional-internet-traffic-and-certificate-transparency-insights-on-radar/"><u>Cloudflare Radar</u></a>. CT has shown its value once more very recently by surfacing a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/"><u>rogue certificate for 1.1.1.1</u></a>.</p><p>Certificate transparency works by having independent parties run <i>CT logs</i>. Before issuing a certificate, a CA must first submit it to at least two different CT logs. An SCT is a signature of a CT log that acts as a proof, a <i>receipt</i>, that the certificate has been logged.</p>
<div>
<h3>Tailoring signature schemes</h3>
<a href="#tailoring-signature-schemes">
</a>
</div>
<p>There are two aspects of how a signature can be used that are worthwhile to highlight: whether the <b>public key is included</b> with the signature, and whether the signature is <b>online</b> or <b>offline</b>.</p><p>For the SCTs and the signature of the root on the intermediate, the public key is not transmitted during the handshake. Thus, for those, a signature scheme with smaller signatures but larger public keys, such as MAYO, SNOVA, or UOV, would be particularly well-suited. For the other signatures, the public key is included, and it’s more important to minimize the sizes of the combined public key and signature.</p><p>The handshake signature is the only signature that is created online — all the other signatures are created ahead of time.  The handshake signature is created and verified only once, whereas the other signatures are typically verified many times by different clients. This means that for the handshake signature, it’s advantageous to balance signing and verification time which are both in the <i>hot path</i>, whereas for the other signatures having better verification time at the cost of slower signing is worthwhile. This is one of the advantages RSA still enjoys over elliptic curve signatures today.</p><p>Putting together different signature schemes is a fun puzzle, but it also comes with some drawbacks. Using multiple different schemes increases the attack surface because an algorithmic or implementation vulnerability in one compromises the whole. Also, the whole ecosystem needs to implement and optimize multiple algorithms, which is a significant burden.</p>
<div>
<h2>Putting it together</h2>
<a href="#putting-it-together">
</a>
</div>
<p>So, what are some reasonable combinations to try?</p>
<div>
<h3>With NIST’s current picks</h3>
<a href="#with-nists-current-picks">
</a>
</div>
<p>With the draft standards available today, we do not have a lot of options.</p><p>If we simply switch to ML-DSA-44 for all signatures, we’re adding 15kB of data that needs to be transmitted from the server to the client during the TLS handshake. Is that a lot? Probably. We will address that later on.</p><p>If we wait a bit and replace all but the handshake signature with FN-DSA-512, we’re looking at adding only 7kB. That’s much better, but I have to repeat that it’s difficult to implement FN-DSA-512 signing safely without timing side channels, and there is a good chance we’ll shoot ourselves in the foot if we’re not careful. Another way to shoot ourselves in the foot <i>today</i> is with stateful hash-based signatures, as we explain <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#stateful-hash-based-signatures"><u>here</u></a>. All in all, FN-DSA-512 and stateful hash-based signatures tempt us with a similar and clear performance benefit over ML-DSA-44, but are difficult to use safely.</p>
<div>
<h3>Signatures on the horizon</h3>
<a href="#signatures-on-the-horizon">
</a>
</div>
<p>There are some promising new signature schemes submitted to the NIST onramp.</p><p>Purely looking at sizes, SQISign I is the clear winner, even beating RSA-2048. Unfortunately, the computation required for signing, and crucially verification, are too high. SQISign is in a worse position than FN-DSA with implementation security: it’s very complicated and it’s unclear how to perform signing in <i>constant time</i>. For niche applications, SQISign might be useful, but for general adoption verification times need to improve significantly, even if that requires a larger signature. Over the last few years there has been amazing progress in improving verification time; simplifying the algorithm; and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/832"><u>implementation security</u></a> for (variants of) SQISign. They’re not there yet, but the gap has shrunk much more than we’d have expected. If the pace of improvement holds, then a future SQISign could well be viable for TLS.</p><p>One conservative contender is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48910-X_15"><u>UOV (unbalanced oil and vinegar)</u></a>. It is an old multivariate scheme with a large public key (66.5kB), but small signatures (96 bytes). Over the decades, there have been many attempts to add some structure to UOV public keys, to get a better balance between public key and signature size. Many of these so-called <i>structured multivariate </i>schemes, which includes Rainbow and GeMMS, unfortunately have been broken dramatically <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf"><u>“with a laptop over the weekend”</u></a>. MAYO and SNOVA, which we’ll get to in a bit, are the latest attempts at structured multivariate. UOV itself has remained mostly unscathed. Surprisingly in 2025, Lars Ran found a completely new <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1143"><u>“wedges” attack</u></a> on UOV. It doesn’t affect UOV much, although SNOVA and MAYO are hit harder. Why the attack is noteworthy, is that it’s based on a relatively simple idea: it is surprising it wasn’t found before. Now, getting back to performance: if we combine UOV for the root and SCTs with ML-DSA-44 for the others, we’re looking at only 10kB — close to FN-DSA-512.</p><p>Now, let’s turn to the main event:</p>
<div>
<h3>The fight between MAYO versus SNOVA</h3>
<a href="#the-fight-between-mayo-versus-snova">
</a>
</div>
<p>Looking at the roster today, MAYO and particularly SNOVA look great from a performance standpoint. Last year, SNOVA and MAYO were closer in performance, but they have diverged quite a bit.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://pqmayo.org/"><u>MAYO</u></a> is designed by the cryptographer that broke <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf"><u>Rainbow</u></a>. As a structured multivariate scheme, its security requires careful scrutiny, but its utility (assuming it is not broken) is very appealing. MAYO allows for a fine-grained tradeoff between signature and public key size. For the submission, to keep things simple, the authors proposed two concrete variants: MAYO<sub>one</sub> with balanced signature (454 bytes) and public key (1.4kB) sizes, and MAYO<sub>two</sub> that has signatures of 216 bytes, while keeping the public key manageable at 4.3kB. Verification times are excellent, while signing times are somewhat slower than ECDSA, but far better than RSA. Combining both variants in the obvious way, we’re only looking at 4.3kB. These numbers are a bit higher than last year, as MAYO adjusted its parameters again slightly to account for newly discovered attacks.</p><p>Over the competition, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://snova.pqclab.org/"><u>SNOVA</u></a> has been hit harder by attacks than MAYO. SNOVA’s response has been more aggressive: instead of just tweaking parameters to adjust, they have also made larger changes to the internals of the scheme, to counter the attacks and to get a performance improvement to boot. Combining SNOVA<sub>(37,17,16,2)</sub> and SNOVA<sub>(24,5,23,4)</sub> in the obvious way, we’re looking at adding just an amazing 2.1kB.</p><p>We see a face-off shaping up between the risky but much smaller SNOVA, and the conservative but slower MAYO. Zooming out, both have very welcome performance, and both are too risky to deploy now. Ran’s new wedges attack is an example that the field of multivariate cryptanalysis still holds surprises, and needs more eyes and time. It’s too soon to pick a winner between SNOVA and MAYO: let them continue to compete. Even if they turn out to be secure, neither is likely to be standardized by 2029, which means we cannot rely on them for the initial migration to post-quantum authentication.</p><p>Stepping back, is the 15kB for ML-DSA-44 actually that bad?</p>
<div>
<h2>Do we really care about the extra bytes?</h2>
<a href="#do-we-really-care-about-the-extra-bytes">
</a>
</div>
<p>On average, around 18 million TLS connections are established with Cloudflare per second. Upgrading each to ML-DSA, would take 2.1Tbps, which is 0.5% of our current total network capacity. No problem so far. The question is how these extra bytes affect performance.</p><p>It will take 15kB extra to swap in ML-DSA-44. That’s a lot compared to the typical handshake today, but it’s not a lot compared to the JavaScript and images served on many web pages. The key point is that the change we must make here affects every single TLS connection, whether it’s used for a bloated website, or a time-critical API call. Also, it’s not just about waiting a bit longer. If you have spotty cellular reception, that extra data can make the difference between being able to load a page, and having the connection time out. (As an aside, talking about bloat: many apps perform a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/tls-on-android/tls-on-android.pdf"><u>surprisingly high number of TLS handshakes</u></a>).</p><p>Just like with key agreement, performance isn’t our only concern: we also want the connection to succeed in the first place. Back in 2021, <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sizing-up-post-quantum-signatures/"><u>we ran an experiment</u></a> artificially enlarging the certificate chain to simulate larger post-quantum certificates. We summarize the result <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#do-we-really-care-about-the-extra-bytes"><u>here</u></a>. One key take-away is that some clients or middleboxes don’t like certificate chains larger than 10kB. This is problematic for a <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/063.pdf"><u>single-certificate migration</u></a> strategy. In this approach, the server installs a single traditional certificate that contains a separate post-quantum certificate in a so-called non-critical extension. A client that does not support post-quantum certificates will ignore the extension. In this approach, installing the single certificate will immediately break all clients with compatibility issues, making it a non-starter. On the performance side there is also a steep drop in performance at 10kB because of the initial congestion window.</p><p>
</p><p>Is 9kB too much? The slowdown in TLS handshake time would be approximately 15%. We felt the latter is workable, but far from ideal: such a slowdown is noticeable and people might hold off deploying post-quantum certificates before it’s too late.
</p><p>Chrome is more cautious and set 10% as their target for maximum TLS handshake time regression. They <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-signatures-2024/#fnref:3"><u>report</u></a> that deploying post-quantum key agreement has already incurred a 4% slowdown in TLS handshake time, for the extra 1.1kB from server-to-client and 1.2kB from client-to-server. That slowdown is proportionally larger than the 15% we found for 9kB, but that could be explained by slower upload speeds than download speeds. </p><p>There has been pushback against the focus on TLS handshake times. One argument is that session resumption alleviates the need for sending the certificates again. A second argument is that the data required to visit a typical website dwarfs the additional bytes for post-quantum certificates. One example is this <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/the-impact-of-data-heavy-post-quantum-tls-1-3-on-the-time-to-last-byte-of-real-world-connections"><u>2024 publication</u></a>, where Amazon researchers have simulated the impact of large post-quantum certificates on data-heavy TLS connections. They argue that typical connections transfer multiple requests and hundreds of kilobytes, and for those the TLS handshake slowdown disappears in the margin.</p><p>Are session resumption and hundreds of kilobytes over a connection typical though? We’d like to share what we see. We focus on QUIC connections, which are likely initiated by browsers or browser-like clients. Of all QUIC connections with Cloudflare that carry at least one HTTP request, 27% are <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/"><u>resumptions</u></a>, meaning that key material from a previous TLS connection is reused, avoiding the need to transmit certificates. The median number of bytes transferred from server-to-client over a resumed QUIC connection is 4.4kB, while the average is 259kB. For non-resumptions the median is 8.1kB and average is 583kB. This vast difference between median and average indicates that a small fraction of data-heavy connections skew the average. In fact, only 15.5% of all QUIC connections transfer more than 100kB.</p><p>The median certificate chain today (with compression) is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-cert-abridge-02#section-4"><u>3.2kB</u></a>. That means that almost 40% of all data transferred from server to client on more than half of the non-resumed QUIC connections are just for the certificates, and this only gets worse with post-quantum algorithms. For the majority of QUIC connections, using ML-DSA-44 as a drop-in replacement for classical signatures would more than double the number of transmitted bytes over the lifetime of the connection.</p><p>It sounds quite bad if the vast majority of data transferred for a typical connection is just for the post-quantum certificates. It’s still only a proxy for what is actually important: the effect on metrics relevant to the end-user, such as the browsing experience (e.g. <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp"><u>largest contentful paint</u></a>) and the amount of data those certificates take from a user’s monthly data cap. We will continue to investigate and get a better understanding of the impact.</p>

<h2>Way forward for post-quantum authentication</h2>
<a href="#way-forward-for-post-quantum-authentication">
</a>
</div>
<p>The path for migrating the Internet to post-quantum authentication is much less clear than with key agreement. Unless we can get performance much closer to today’s authentication, we expect the vast majority to keep post-quantum authentication disabled. Postponing enabling post-quantum authentication until Q-day draws near carries a real risk that we will not see the issues before it’s too late to fix. That’s why it’s essential to make post-quantum authentication performant enough to be turned on by default.</p><p>We’re exploring various ideas to reduce the number of signatures, in increasing order of ambition: leaving out intermediates; KEMTLS; and Merkle Tree Certificates. We covered these in <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#reducing-number-of-signatures"><u>detail last year</u></a>. Most progress has been made on the last one: <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates</u></a> (MTC). In this proposal, in the common case, all signatures except the handshake signature are replaced by a short &lt;800 byte Merkle tree proof. This could well allow for post-quantum authentication that’s actually faster than using traditional certificates today! Together with Chrome, we’re going to try it out by the end of the year: read about it in <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/"><u>this blog</u></a> post.</p>

<h3>Not just TLS, authentication, and key agreement</h3>
<a href="#not-just-tls-authentication-and-key-agreement">
</a>
</div>
<p>Despite its length, in this blog post, we have only really touched upon migrating TLS. And even TLS we did not cover completely, as we have not discussed <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello"><u>Encrypted ClientHello</u></a> (we didn’t forget about it). Although important, TLS is not the only protocol key to the security of the Internet. We want to briefly mention a few other challenges, but cannot go into detail. One particular challenge is DNSSEC, which is responsible for securing the resolution of domain names.</p><p>Although key agreement and signatures are the most widely used cryptographic primitives, over the last few years we have seen the adoption of more <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/fancy-cryptography/fancy-cryptography"><u>esoteric cryptography</u></a> to serve more advanced use cases, such as unlinkable tokens with <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-pass-standard"><u>Privacy Pass</u></a> / <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standardhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard"><u>PAT</u></a>, anonymous credentials, and <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-geo-key-manager-v2"><u>attribute based encryption</u></a> to name a few. For most of these advanced cryptographic schemes, there is no known practical post-quantum alternative yet. Although to our delight there have been great advances in post-quantum anonymous credentials.</p>

<h2>What you can do today to stay safe against quantum attacks</h2>
<a href="#what-you-can-do-today-to-stay-safe-against-quantum-attacks">
</a>
</div>
<p>To summarize, there are two main post-quantum migrations to keep an eye on: key agreement, and certificates.</p><p>We recommend moving to <b>post-quantum key agreement </b>to counter store-now/decrypt-later attacks, which only requires a software update on both sides. That means that with the quick adoption (we’re <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/pqc-support/"><u>keeping a list</u></a>) of X25519MLKEM768 across software and services, you might well be secure already against store-now/decrypt-later! On Cloudflare Radar you can <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#browser-support"><u>check</u></a> whether your browser supports X25519MLKEM768; if you use Firefox, there is <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pqspy/"><u>an extension</u></a> to check support of websites while you visit; you can scan whether your website supports it <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://pqscan.io/"><u>here</u></a>; and you can use Wireshark to check for it <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/tls-hybrid-kex.html"><u>on the wire</u></a>.</p><p>Those are just spot checks. For a proper migration, you’ll need to figure out where cryptography is used. That’s a tall order, as most organizations have a hard time tracking all software, services, and external vendors they use in the first place. There will be systems that are difficult to upgrade or have external dependencies, but in many cases it’s simple. In fact, in many cases, you’ll spend a lot of time to find out that they are already done.</p><p>As figuring out <i>what to do</i> is the bulk of the work, it’s perhaps tempting to split that out as a first milestone: create a detailed inventory first; the so-called <a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IBM/CBOM"><u>cryptographic bill of materials</u></a> (CBOM). Don’t let an inventory become a goal on its own: we need to keep our eyes on the ball. Most cases are easy: if you figured out what to do to migrate in one case, don’t wait and context switch, but just do it. That doesn’t mean it’ll be fast: this is a marathon not a sprint, but you’ll be surprised how much ground can be covered by getting started.</p><p><b>Certificates.</b> At the time of writing this blog in October 2025, the final standards for post-quantum certificates are not set yet. Hopefully that won’t take too long to resolve. But there is much that you can do now to prepare for post-quantum certificates that you won’t regret at all. Keep software up-to-date. Automate certificate issuance. Ensure you can install multiple certificates.</p><p>In case you’re worried about protocol ossification, there is no reason to wait: the final post-quantum standards will not be very different from the draft. You can test with preliminary implementations (or large dummy certificates) today.</p><p>The post-quantum migration is quite unique. Typically, if cryptography is broken, it’s either sudden or gradually making it easy to ignore for a time. In both cases, migrations in the end are rushed. With the quantum threat, we know for sure that we’ll need to replace a lot of cryptography, but we also have time. Instead of just a chore, we invite you to see this as an opportunity: we have to do maintenance now on many systems that rarely get touched. Instead of just hotfixes, now is the opportunity to rethink past choices. </p><p>At least, if you start now. Good luck with your migration, and if you hit any issues, do reach out: ask-research@cloudflare.com</p>
